# email-scraper
Simple tool to extract e-mails from webpages

## Note 
I believe I made this script while learning web-scraping, and that was a loong time ago â€” probably in the first half of 2016. No reason to continue development on this, so I'll be archiving this repo. You're welcome to use it, and fork it. Shoot me an email for anything else. 

#This script was forked i will enhace it and prbably adda UI to it
